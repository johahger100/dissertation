As seen in the test results the Google Glass application was almost always the slowest in all of the tests. However, as the test results only shows the time from when the QR code has been scanned until when the information is being displayed on screen does not differ by more then about half a second between Google Glass and Samsung Galaxy SII, and the difference in time might not be of significance. 

After the user has scanned a QR code and the information is displayed, that is when the actual usage of the application starts. A user might be able to look past the fact that the Google Glass application is slower at scanning and presenting information as the advantages of Google Glass lies not in the speed of the device but rather in the user interface.

The fact that users do not have be use their hands is the major advantage of using Google Glass over a smartphone. Although voice commands are possible to implement in the smartphone application as well, the user must still hold the smartphone or place the smartphone on a surface in order to see the information being displayed. Google Glass puts the display in front of the user and does not require the user to hold the display in any way.

However, the fact that Google Glass was not able to scan more complex QR codes is definitely a negative aspect. Although the product ID:s used in this test were not long enough as to where complexity would become an issue, the complexity of the QR code will be an issue when the database contains many, many more products and the product ID:s are such that the complexity of the QR code is too high for Google Glass to handle.

As such, one clear improvement Google must do on Google Glass is upgrade the camera. Not only to be able to compete with smartphone cameras, which, as seen, were much better already at the time of Google Glass's release, but simply to be able to identify QR codes with high complexity and at longer distances.

Another important aspect of Google Glass is the amount of information the device can display on one screen. As shown in the text length test, a card on Google Glass which only displays text can hold somewhere between 200 and 220 characters, in comparison to smartphones with similar layout design, which can hold somewhere between 550 and 750 characters.

According to Google's guidelines for writing text for Google Glass, the text should be brief and simple, with the most important part of the text first and without repetition. Clearly, with the limit in text length, writing short and precise text is important on Google Glass. Getting information across to the user without having to divide text up on several cards is important, for instance when writing instructions. Depending on the user to scroll back and forth between cards in order to read one instruction would not be good design, and as such instructions should be simple and brief, similar to the way the are in the application described in this dissertation.
