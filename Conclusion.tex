As seen in the test results the Google Glass application was almost always the slowest in all of the tests. However, as the test results only shows the times from when the QR code has been scanned until when the information is being displayed on screen the difference in time might not be of significance. 

After the user has scanned a QR code and the information is displayed, that is when the actually usage of the application starts. A user might be able to look past the fact that the Google Glass application is slower at scanning and presenting information as the advantages of Google Glass lies not in the speed of the device but rather in the user interface.

The fact that users do not have be use their hands is the major advantage of using Google Glass over a smartphone. Although voice commands are possible to implement in the smartphone application as well, the user must still hold the smartphone or place the smartphone on a surface in order to see the information being displayed. Google Glass puts the display in front of the user and does not require the user to hold the display in any way.

However, the fact that Google Glass was not able to scan more complex QR codes is definitely a negative aspect. Although the product ID:s used in this test were not long enough as to where complexity would become an issue, the complexity of the QR code will be an issue when the database contains many, many more products and the product ID:s are such that the complexity of the QR code is too high for Google Glass to handle.

%Hopefully Google will replace the camera on Google Glass with a better one.
