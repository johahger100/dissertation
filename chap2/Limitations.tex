%How about people wearing glasses normally? Will the boss require employees to get lenses?
An early concern with Google Glass came from people who wore regular glasses every day as Google Glass seemed to require their own separate frames. Isabelle Olsson at Google responded on the issue on April 12th 2012 with the following: ``We ideally want Project Glass to work for everyone, and we're experimenting with designs that are meant to be extendable to different types of frames.''.\cite{GoogleGlassFrameResponse}\\

Today many eyecare providers have been trained for Google Glass and Glass frames. These trained eyecare providers are however mostly located in the United States,\cite{frameProviders} but Google points out that many eyecare providers should be able to help replace the lenses on Google Glass' frame\cite{framesGlass}.\\

%documented eye pain from looking at a screen for too long. Also conserns regarding looking at something that not both eyes can see. Can give headache and slighted eye aligntment.\\

%A study performed in 2002 regarding the effect of head mounted displays showed that head mounted displays may only be of help to the user under controlled forms. Whenever the surrounding got too distracting, for instance within a moving crowd, performance went down. The study however noted that pilots had been able to successfully turn HMD into something they could use to their advantage. Since the study was not done over a long period of time where the participants got training in using their HMD devices this could potentially play a major part.\\

%HMD:s could potential be of great service to users as long as users take the time to get use to the HMD device.\cite{laramee02}\\
