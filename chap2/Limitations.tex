%How about people wearing glasses normally? Will the boss require employees to get lenses?
An early concern was of those people who wear regular glasses every day. Would they not be able to use Google Glass as it is a product worn as regular glasses. This concern got a quick respons as only eight days after the initial reveal it was announced that users would be able to use Google Glass with regular prescription glasses. Isabelle Olsson at Google responded on the issue on April 12th with the following: ``We ideally want Project Glass to work for everyone, and weâ€™re experimenting with designs that are meant to be extendable to different types of frames.''\\

Today many eyecare providers have been trained for Google Glass and Glass frames. As such they are able to help with prescription glasses suited for a specific user who is also a user of Google Glass. These trained eyecare providers are however mostly located in the United States. While Google points out that many eyecare providers should be able to help replace the lenses on Google Glass' frame it might be an issue that needs to be resolved.\cite{frameProviders}\\

documented eye pain from looking at a screen for too long. Also conserns regarding looking at something that not both eyes can see. Can give headache and slighted eye aligntment.\\

A study performed in 2002 regarding the effect of head mounted displays showed that head mounted displays may only be of help to the user under controlled forms. Whenever the surrounding got too distracting, for instance within a moving crowd, performance went down. The study however noted that pilots had been able to successfully turn HMD into something they could use to their advantage. Since the study was not done over a long period of time where the participants got training in using their HMD devices this could potentially play a major part.\\

HMD:s could potential be of great service to users as long as users take the time to get use to the HMD device.\cite{laramee02}\\
