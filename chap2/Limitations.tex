%How about people wearing glasses normally? Will the boss require employees to get lenses?
An early concern with Google Glass came from people who wore regular glasses every day as Google Glass seemed to require their own separate frames. Isabelle Olsson at Google responded on the issue on April 12th 2012 with the following: ``We ideally want Project Glass to work for everyone, and we're experimenting with designs that are meant to be extendable to different types of frames.''.\cite{GoogleGlassFrameResponse}\\

Today many eyecare providers have been trained for Google Glass and Glass frames. These trained eyecare providers are however mostly located in the United States,\cite{frameProviders} but Google points out that many eyecare providers should be able to help replace the lenses on Google Glass' frame\cite{framesGlass}.\\

A study performed in 2002\cite{laramee02}, regarding the effects of HMDs, showed that HMDs may only be of help to users under controlled forms. Whenever the surrounding gets too distracting, for instance within a moving crowd, performance goes down. The study however noted that pilots had been able to successfully turn HMD into something they could use to their advantage. Since the study was not done over a long period of time the participants was potentially not given enough time to get used to wearing and using their HMDs.\\

%HMD:s could potential be of great service to users as long as users take the time to get use to the HMD device.\cite{laramee02}\\
