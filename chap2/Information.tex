[TODO what is information]

Information can be displayed in a number of different ways.

\subsubsection{Text}
Text is one of the oldest forms of presenting information [***TODO REFERENCE***]. Text is also a simple presenting form to use that does not require much high end hardware. Other forms of presenting information require more memory, more computational power and more graphical power. Text also has the advantage that the user can read through text at their own speed. Text does not have any perception of time.\\

Text does however have the disadvantage of requiring attention. The person reading the text must keep the attention on the text throughout and can not look away in order to receive all the information being presented. Text is also restricted to the language the text has been written in. In order to globalise an information presentation several texts must be written so that users from different nations can read the text.

\subsubsection{Images}
Photos and graphics

+
can show what to do
can be seen at personal speed

-
require attention

\subsubsection{Audio}
Images and text both have the disadvantage of requiring full attention in order for the information to be perceived. 
+
eyes can be focused on something else

-
does not stop, have a set speed

\subsubsection{Video}
Since video consist of many images bundled together video could give the same advantages as images. Video presents the viewer with images at such speed that the images gives the impression of movement. Video may also include audio. The inclusion of audio gives video all the same advantages as audio. In other words video could potentially give the advantages of two other forms of information presentation.\\

Similar to audio, video is constantly moving. The viewer are bound to the playback speed of the video. Even though a video may be paused or even rewind the viewer is not in the same amount of full control as with images or text. With text and images the reader (or reader) can deceide the speed at which the information should be perceived for themselves. If the video does not include audio video, similar to images or text requires full attention in order for the information to be perceived.
