[TODO what is information]

Information can be displayed in a number of different ways.

\subsubsection{Text}
Text is one of the oldest forms of presenting information [***TODO REFERENCE***]. Text is also a simple presenting form to use that does not require much high end hardware. Other forms of presenting information require more memory, more computational power and more graphical power. Text also has the advatage that the user can read through text at their own speed. Text does not have any perception of time.\\

Text does however have the disadvantage of requiring attention. The person reading the text must keep the attention on the text throughout and can not look away in order to receive all the information being presented. Text is also bounded to the language the text has been written in. In order to globalise an information presentation several texts must be written so that users from different nation can read the text.
