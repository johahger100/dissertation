%Compare to phones!
Despite being two very different devices, the mobile phone and Glass, Google's design recommendations are not vastly different for the two. For mobile phones the ask developers to think of simplicity and clarity. They put much emphasis on making things easy to use.\\

There are some differences however. For mobile phones Google also recommend that developers keep track of what the users have done in the past. They ask developers to remember the user's input history and customisation, all to make it easier for the user when they (hopefully) come back to the application.

Google differ in how they want developers to design applications for mobile phone and Glass respectively. On mobile phones they are much more open to developers using their own ides. They encourage freedom and give more subtle hints of how to design. For instance they want developers to make applications fun and easy to use. They recommend consistency and a rewarding application.\\

Designing for Google Glass comes with a bit more restrictions. \\
