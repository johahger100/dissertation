The main way for a user to give input to Google Glass is via the touchpanel that is mounted on the right hand side of Glass, along the frame. Users are able to swipe as well as tap, which gives them control similar to that of a Smart TV's user interface. Where with a TV controller the user would maneuver with a simple cross layout (up, down, right and left) the buttons have on Glass been replaced by a touchpanel.\\

%% Insert image of Google Glass graphical user interface here!!!

The graphical interface is displayed at the top right through a projection coming from the right on a thick piece of glass. This technique lines up the image with the users sight but does not give any projection outwards.\\

The interface is built with cards. Each card represents an activity.\\
