Chapter~\ref{sec:background} discuss relevant background information regarding Google Glass. The chapter will include an introduction to what Google Glass is, how they came about and what features they have. The background chapter will also discuss similar products to Google Glass, as well as compare Google Glass to smartphones. Finally chapter two will include some discussion on topics relevant to the project, including QR code and ways of presenting information.

The~\ref{sec:design}rd chapter is about the design of the project. The discussion revolves around how the application is intended to work, and what limitations may apply to the implementation of the application, both on Google Glass and smartphone. The third chapter also discusses the design of the tests done on the application.

Chapter~\ref{sec:implementation} describes the implementation part of the project. The flow of the application is described in detail. Specific aspect of the application is also described in more detail. The layout of the slides as well as the voice commands. The experimental setup and how the tests were performed is also described here.

In chapter~\ref{sec:resultevaluation} the results of the tests are presented. The results are presented along with comments regarding how the results are to be interpreted as well as comments on any potential error factors during testing.

The~\ref{sec:conclusion}th and final chapter contains conclusions on the project. The conclusions regards the test results, as well as conclusions on the project as a whole. Chapter six also includes comments based on personal user experience from using Google Glass for about three months. Finally future work is discussed and the report is concluded with some concluding remarks.

Attached to the dissertation, after the reference list, are appendixes. In appendix~\ref{sec:abbreviations} abbreviations used throughout the dissertation are listed. Appendix~\ref{app:results} shows all the individual test results. Project code can be found in appendix~\ref{app:code}. Appendix~\ref{app:projectspec} is the last appendix which contains the original project specification, written in Swedish.
