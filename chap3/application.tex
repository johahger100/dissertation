[TODO Describe what the applications should look like]

The application designed and implemented in parallell with this report is a proof-of-concept of an application used for construction. The application is intended to function as a substitute for manuals, where Google Glass will give the ability to scroll through building instructions hands-free. A proof-of-concept of an application for smartphones has been designed and implemented as well, in order to provide a point of reference as well as help evaluate the pros and cons of using Google Glass.

The application is meant to scan a QR Code, which will give information on the product, enabling the application to retrieve building instructions from a back end database. The instructions, as well as necessary components, will then be presented on screen in a slide show, giving users the ability to scroll through at their own pace.
