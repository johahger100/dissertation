Despite being two different devices, the smartphone and Google Glass, Google's design recommendations are not that different for the two. Google ask developers who are designing for smartphones to think of simplicity and clarity. Google put much emphasis on making applications easy to use.

However, there are some differences. For smartphones Google also recommend developers to keep track of what users have done in the past. Google ask developers to remember the user's input history and customisation in order to make the experience more pleasant for returning users~\cite{androidDesignPrinciples}.

Google differ in how they want developers to design applications for smartphones and Google Glass respectively. On smartphones, Google are much more open to developers using their own ideas. Google encourage freedom and give more subtle hints of how to design in contrast to the more strict guidelines for Google Glass. For instance, Google want developers to make applications for smartphones fun and easy to use. They recommend consistency and a rewarding application.

Designing for Google Glass comes with a few more restrictions.
