%How did Google Glass come about? History!
Mobiles today are used as a nervous tick. It is a distraction and something that pulls your attention away from the real world. At least that is what Sergey Brin, one of the founders of Google, claimed during a Ted Talk presentation in February 2013.\cite{tedtalkWhyGlass} Brin stated that if he was a smoker he would probably light a cigarette at those times when he now uses his phone.

Brin and his team wanted to create something that would make interaction with technology easy and fast and not distract from reality. They wanted to keep the information more handy and close by than a phone stuck in the users pocket. But they also wanted to keep the line of sight free. Thad Starner, technical lead/manager on Google Glass, wrote in an article in 2013,\cite{6504855} that he sought out to build something as intuitive as a watch. An extension of the self, as he stated. And so Google started working on Project Glass. 




% The idea behind Glass was to minimise the time between intention and action
% users should not have to bring up something from their pockets each time they want to interact with technology
% they should be able to just simply interact
% They wanted to create something as intuitive as a watch. 
% checking the watch is something a user might do without actually thinking about what the time is.
% they might have to check again if someone were to ask them what the time is.
% Glass should be an extension of the self rather than another device.
% // Thad Starner - technical lead/manager on Google Glass

% Sergey Brin, one of the founders at Google, has similar ideas
% ted talk he spoke about how checking the phone was something he did without reason
% putting notifications more easily accessible would minimise interaction with technology because the user
% would not have to check if any updates have come in, they would know right away



April 4th, 2012, Google announced ``Project Glass''. Glass was under development for several years at Google's research and development department, Google X. The idea behind the device was to make technology easier to access but also to only be available when the users wants to. Serge Brin, on of the founders of Google, did a Ted Talk in February 2013 where he talked about why they decided to produce the device. His argument was that smartphones was something users kept looking at even when they did not want to. They might have missed something. Instead Google wanted to create a device that would notify the user [TODO WTF, doesn't a phone do this!?!?!]

Thad Starner, technical lead/manager on Google Glass, claimed that Glass is supposed to be an extension of the self. He compared the device to a watch. A watch is an easy to access device that seems natural to its wearers. Starner claimed that when an individual looks at his or her's watch
