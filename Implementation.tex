\subsection{Android Studio}
Both the smartphone application as well as the Google Glass application was developed in Android Studio~\cite{androidStudio}. Android Studio is a development environment developed by Google. %[TODO why Android Studio]

\subsection{ZXing}
The application was built upon the open-source barcode image processing library, Zebra Crossing (ZXing)~\cite{zxing}. %[TODO Vilka förändringar har gjorts]

\subsubsection{BarcodeEye}
The Google Glass application was built upon the Google Glass port of the ZXing library, known as BarcodeEye~\cite{barcodeEye}.% [TODO vilka förändringar har gjorts]%While a slideview was implemented in BarcodeEye already, the information displayed was static [todo, var den statisk]. The slideview consited of only two slides [todo code example of how it was static]. Mixing images with text was not possible either. Information also had to be encoded directly into the QR code and could not be downloaded by an encoded link.

o   Implementation - Present your project implemetion in general
o   Information - Give details here (possibly several sub-sections)
o   Summary - for this chapter

% Mobile phone application
% Uses Zxing - library for QR code scanning [Link to gihub repository missing!!!]
% can display both text and images 
% 
% Google Glass Application
% Uses BarcodeEye - library for QR Code Scanning (port of Zxing for Google Glass) [Link to github repository missing!!!]
% Can display text, images still todo
% Much easier to add slides on Google Glass compared to Mobile Phone Application. Probably because Cards is standard interface for Google Glass (might also be because simple API, check CardPresenter!!!)
% Very difficult to add images since cards can't be changed after .getView() has been called
% Need to call .notifyViewChanged() but does not work anyway (yet) seems to only start the activity over which calls the execute method again if no check has been put in place
