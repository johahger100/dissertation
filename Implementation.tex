\subsection{Android Studio}
Both the smartphone application as well as the Google Glass application were developed in Android Studio~\cite{androidStudio}. Android Studio is a development environment developed by Google. Both applications were initially being developed in Eclipse~\cite{eclipse}, however development soon shifted to Android Studio as Android Studio is now the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android~\cite{androidIDE}. The shift was done without complications as Android Studio contains an import feature enabling developers to import projects previously not developed in Android Studio~\cite{androidIDE}.%[TODO why Android Studio]

%\subsection{ZXing}
%The application was built upon the open-source barcode image processing library, Zebra Crossing (ZXing).

%\subsubsection{BarcodeEye}
%The Google Glass application was built upon the Google Glass port of the ZXing library, known as BarcodeEye~\cite{barcodeEye}.% [TODO vilka förändringar har gjorts]%While a slideview was implemented in BarcodeEye already, the information displayed was static [todo, var den statisk]. The slideview consited of only two slides [todo code example of how it was static]. Mixing images with text was not possible either. Information also had to be encoded directly into the QR code and could not be downloaded by an encoded link.

\subsection{Card Layout}
Google provides developers with a set of predefined layouts for different types of cards. The following predefined layouts have been used in the implementation: ``Title'', ``Columns'' and ``Text''. The Title layout was used for the first card of the slide view, which shows the product name as well as an image of the product as it is supposed to look when finished.

	\begin{figure}[H]%ht!]
		\centering
    		\subfloat[The title card layout.]{{\includegraphics[width=70mm]{images/demo/titleCard}}}
   		 \qquad
		\subfloat[The column card layout.]{{\includegraphics[width=70mm]{images/demo/columnImage}}}

    		\subfloat[The text card layout.]{{\includegraphics[width=70mm]{images/demo/instructionText}}}
    		\qquad
        		\subfloat[The image card layout.]{{\includegraphics[width=70mm]{images/demo/instructionImage}}}
   		 \qquad
		\caption{The different layouts used within the application.}
		\label{imagesSimilarProducts}
	\end{figure}

The Columns card layout was used for when an instruction or component was to be presented in both text and image form. Since the Columns layout split the card, with an image to the left and text to the right, the Columns layout was the most reasonable choice. If the information being presented, either a component or an instruction, instead were to only be presented as text the Text layout was used. The Text layout displayed text on screen, with dynamically sized text. In other words, if there was a lot of text the text would be resized to fit the screen.

Using the predefined layouts in the code was easily achieved as the implementation needed was mostly plug-and-play. The \texttt{CardBuilder} class took the layout as an argument. Having received an instance of the \texttt{CardBuilder} class what remained was to simply input the necessary information. Setting an image was done slightly differently than written information as images were loaded in using a separate thread. As soon as the \texttt{CardBuilder} method \texttt{getView} was called the card was built with the information that had been inputed.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption={Initialisation of the CardBuilder class}, label=todo]
CardBuilder cardBuilder = new CardBuilder(context, CardBuilder.Layout.COLUMNS);
.setText(getText())
.setFootNote(mFootNote)
.setTimestamp(mTimeStamp);

cardBuilder = (new LoadImage(isTitleCard(), getByteArray()).doInBackground(cardBuilder));

return cardBuilder.getView();
\end{lstlisting}

o   Implementation - Present your project implemetion in general
o   Information - Give details here (possibly several sub-sections)
o   Summary - for this chapter

% Mobile phone application
% Uses Zxing - library for QR code scanning [Link to gihub repository missing!!!]
% can display both text and images 
% 
% Google Glass Application
% Uses BarcodeEye - library for QR Code Scanning (port of Zxing for Google Glass) [Link to github repository missing!!!]
% Can display text, images still todo
% Much easier to add slides on Google Glass compared to Mobile Phone Application. Probably because Cards is standard interface for Google Glass (might also be because simple API, check CardPresenter!!!)
% Very difficult to add images since cards can't be changed after .getView() has been called
% Need to call .notifyViewChanged() but does not work anyway (yet) seems to only start the activity over which calls the execute method again if no check has been put in place
