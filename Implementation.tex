\subsection{Android Studio}
Both the smartphone application, as well as the Google Glass application, were developed in Android Studio~\cite{androidStudio}. Android Studio is a development environment developed by Google. Both applications were initially being developed in Eclipse~\cite{eclipse}, however development soon shifted to Android Studio as Android Studio is now the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android~\cite{androidIDE}. The change was made without complications as Android Studio contains an import feature, enabling developers to import projects previously not developed in Android Studio~\cite{androidIDE}.

\subsection{API level}
The API (application programming interface) level is an attribute of Android applications which identifies the required API level of a device attempting to run the specific application~\cite{androidAPI}. Each API level contains a certain set of features, which must exist on the device in order for the device to be able to run a specific application.

The Google Glass application has the API level 19, as Google started distributing the Glass Development Kit (GDK) with API level 19, enabling developers to use Google Glass specific features and to develop applications for Google Glass~\cite{glassAPI}. The smartphone application, on the other hand, uses the API level 12, as no Google Glass specific features were used in the smartphone application.

Android applications also have a target API level, describing the API level best suited for the application, as some changes might have been made in the API to the functionality used in the application. The Google Glass application has the target API level 19, which is the same level as the required API level. The smartphone application has the target API level 22, as that was the latest API level released as of writing this dissertation~\cite{api22}.


%\subsection{ZXing}
%The application was built upon the open-source barcode image processing library, Zebra Crossing (ZXing).

%\subsubsection{BarcodeEye}
%The Google Glass application was built upon the Google Glass port of the ZXing library, known as BarcodeEye~\cite{barcodeEye}.% [TODO vilka förändringar har gjorts]%While a slideview was implemented in BarcodeEye already, the information displayed was static [todo, var den statisk]. The slideview consited of only two slides [todo code example of how it was static]. Mixing images with text was not possible either. Information also had to be encoded directly into the QR code and could not be downloaded by an encoded link.

\subsection{Card Layout}
Google provides developers with a set of predefined layouts for different types of cards, which were used in the Google Glass application and used as basis for the design of the different layouts for the slides in the smartphone application. The following predefined layouts were used in the implementation: ``Title'', ``Columns'', ``Text'' and ``Caption''. The Title layout was used for the first card of the slide view, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cardLayout}~(a), which shows the product name as well as an image of the product as it is supposed to look when finished.

	\begin{figure}[ht!]

    		\subfloat[The title card layout.]{{\includegraphics[width=70mm]{images/demo/titleCard}}}

   		 \qquad
		\caption{The different layouts used within the Google Glass application.}
		\label{fig:cardLayout}
	\end{figure}

The Columns card layout, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cardLayout}~(b) was used for when an instruction or component was to be presented with both text and an image. Since the Columns layout split the card, with an image to the left and text to the right, the Columns layout was the most reasonable choice when presenting both text and an image. An alternative would have been to display the text on top of the image. However, then the image could potentially have been hidden behind a larger amount of text. The title card used both text and image as the specifics of the image was not as important, and the text was only the product name, which should not be long enough to cover up the entire screen.

If the information, either a component or an instruction, were to be presented as text only, the Text layout, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cardLayout}~(c) was used. The Text layout displayed dynamically sized text. In other words, if there was a lot of text being displayed the text would be resized to fit the screen.
\newpage
If the card were to only contain an image, and no text, the Caption layout was used, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cardLayout}~(d). The Caption layout is similar to the Title layout, but in contrast to the Title layout the Caption layout also has both a footer and a timestamp at the bottom of the card on the left and right side respectively. The Caption layout enables the use of an actual caption. However a caption is not required by the Caption layout and neither was a caption used in the application as the Caption layout was used when no text was meant to be displayed (not counting the footer and the timestamp which appears on all cards except for the title card).

Using the predefined layouts, the desired layout design was easily achieved as the process consisted mostly of plug-and-play. The \texttt{CardBuilder} class' constructor took the layout as an argument, as seen in Listing~\ref{cardBuilderPlugPlay}. When an instance of the \texttt{CardBuilder} class was created, what remained was to simply input the necessary information, such as the instruction text. Setting an image was done slightly differently than written information as images were loaded in using a separate thread. As soon as the \texttt{CardBuilder} method \texttt{getView} was called, the card was built with the information that had been input.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption={Initialisation of the CardBuilder class}, label=cardBuilderPlugPlay]
CardBuilder cardBuilder = new CardBuilder(context, CardBuilder.Layout.COLUMNS)
	.setText(getText())
	.setFootNote(mFootNote)
	.setTimestamp(mTimeStamp);

cardBuilder = (new LoadImage(isTitleCard(), getByteArray()).doInBackground(cardBuilder));

return cardBuilder.getView();
\end{lstlisting}

%o   Implementation - Present your project implemetion in general
%o   Information - Give details here (possibly several sub-sections)
%o   Summary - for this chapter

% Mobile phone application
% Uses Zxing - library for QR code scanning [Link to gihub repository missing!!!]
% can display both text and images 
% 
% Google Glass Application
% Uses BarcodeEye - library for QR Code Scanning (port of Zxing for Google Glass) [Link to github repository missing!!!]
% Can display text, images still todo
% Much easier to add slides on Google Glass compared to Mobile Phone Application. Probably because Cards is standard interface for Google Glass (might also be because simple API, check CardPresenter!!!)
% Very difficult to add images since cards can't be changed after .getView() has been called
% Need to call .notifyViewChanged() but does not work anyway (yet) seems to only start the activity over which calls the execute method again if no check has been put in place
