		  LaTeX Style Files for KAU Report Format
		  ---------------------------------------

This directory contains the LaTeX class file file kau_report.cls, which
formats your report according to the regulations of the Department of Computer
Science at the University of Karlstad. It also includes some LaTeX Secondary style
files which are loaded automatically by kau_report.cls.

Users access this thesis format with the command

		\documentclass[12pt,twoside]{kau_report}

A number of useful macros are defined for use in this style.  
The usual LaTeX macros  ``\author,'' ``\title,'' and ``\date'' work as
defined in the LaTeX manual.  The argument to \date should be the date
on which the candidate's final examination (defense) is scheduled.

The publication number will be typeset in the center position at the bottom
of the title page and is set with the ``\pubnum'' macro.

The command ``\makekautitle'' will generate a title page formatted according
to the Kau instructions, and including all of the information defined
by the macros above.  The ``\makekautitle'' command should be used
in place of the standard version, ``\maketitle''.

The initial portion of the report, typically the approval page,
abstract, and tables of contents, figures, and tables, are numbered in
roman numerals, while the body of the thesis is numbered in arabic.  The
{frontmatter} environment handles these page numbering conventions.  The
author should place

	\begin{frontmatter}
	...(abstract, contents, etc.)
	\end{frontmatter}

immediately following the \makekautitle command.  The first entry in the
{frontmatter} environment should generally be ``\approved.''  This
command generates a spearate approval page. (For reports that have multiple
authors variations of the ``\approved'' command are used.)

The abstract is produced with the {abstract} environment, which generates
an unnumbered chapter without entry in the table of contents.  The author
should use

	\begin{abstract}
	...(body of abstract goes here)
	\end{abstract}

within the {frontmatter} environment.

An acknowledgements page is produced in the same way as the abstract, with
the {acknowledgements} environment.

Please see the document skeleton.tex for examples of how to use these macros.
