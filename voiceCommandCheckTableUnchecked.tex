		\textbf{todo} & \textbf{Guideline} & \textbf{Good Example} & \textbf{Bad Example} \\ \hline \hline
       
1	&	Is general enough to apply to multiple Glassware, but still has a clear purpose	&	``ok glass, learn a song''	&	``ok glass, learn something'', ``ok glass, learn a song on guitar''	\\ \hline
2	&	Is colloquial and can explain Glass features in a conversation	&	``ok glass, take a picture'' (``You can use Glass to take a picture'')	&	``ok glass, take picture'' (``You can use Glass to take picture'')	\\ \hline
3	&	Is comfortable to say in public	&	``ok glass, find a doctor''	&	``ok glass, find a gynecologist''	\\ \hline
4	&	Brings the user from intent to action as quickly as possible	&	``ok glass, find a recipe for'' (this allows users to speak ``chicken kiev'' and immediately see the recipe)	&	``ok glass, show me a cookbook'' (this forces users to look through a list for what they want)	\\ \hline
5	&	Avoids brand words	&	``ok glass, make a video call''	&	``ok glass, start a hangout''	\\ \hline
6	&	Is long enough to ensure high recognition quality (at least three syllables)	&	``ok glass, make a video call''	&	``ok glass, hangout''	\\ \hline
7	&	Fits on a single line (less than 600px wide at 40px Roboto Thin)	&	``ok glass, add a calendar event''	&	``ok glass, create a new calendar event''	\\ \hline \pagebreak
8	&	Does not sound similar to existing commands	&		&	``ok glass, find a race'' (too similar to ``ok glass, find a place'')	\\ \hline
9	&	Does not require immediate interactivity in Mirror API Glassware. Immediate interactivity is only supported with GDK Glassware.	&	``ok glass, take a note'' (This allows users to speak a note and move on to their next task without worrying about a response from the Glassware.)	&	``ok glass, find a recipe'' (This requires a response from the Glassware so users can view the results. This is an acceptable GDK voice command but not acceptable for the Mirror API.)	\\ \hline
10	&	Has an imperative verb with an object	&	``ok glass, make a video call''	&``ok glass, video call''	\\ \hline
11	&	Uses articles when possible	&	``ok glass, record a video''	&	``ok glass, record video''	\\ \hline
12	&	Uses definite articles only when the object is definite	&	``ok glass, show me the weather''	& ``ok glass, take the picture''	\\ \hline

14	&	Uses me and my when appropriate	&	``ok glass, show me the news''	&	``ok glass, show the news''	\\ \hline
15	&	Refers to Glass as the subject carrying out the action	&	``ok glass, start a run'' (Glass starts Glassware that tracks a run)	&	``ok glass, go running'' (The user is the one that actually goes running)	\\ \hline
