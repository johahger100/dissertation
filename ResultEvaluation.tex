%The following are the results of the tests performed on the application, both on the Google Glass version as well as the smartphone version.

\subsection{Text Length}
The following are the results from evaluating the number of characters that may fit on a card in the Google Glass application, both when using only text and when using both text and an image. The test was performed only once for each device since despite randomising the characters used, the text length would not differ significally from one case to another. As seen in the following results none of the tests resulted in an additional card with only one character. Had that been the case, different combinations of characters may have changed the number of cards necessary to display all of the information. As that is not the case only one test was deemed sufficient enough to determine the number of card required to display the same information as displayed on a smartphone device.

However, some trial and error was part of the process of finding how many characters would fill the smartphone screens. 550 was deemed a suitable number for Samsung Galaxy SII och 750 was deemed a suitable number for Samsung Galaxy SIII, as that many characters filled up the screen and yet still left some room for longer characters or longer words, as seen in Figure~\ref{glassTestTextLengthRaw}. For Samsung Galaxy SII, 600 characters did not fit on the screen, and for Samsung Galaxy SIII, 800 characters did not fit on the screen. As such 550 and 750 respectively was set as the maximum number of characters, although depending on the characters being displayed the text may use up more or less space since an 'i' does not take up as much space as a 'w'. The filled smartphone screens can be seen in Figure~\ref{glassTestTextLengthRaw}.

When translating the results from the smartphones to Google Glass the same text was used and simply copied over to the Google Glass application. The result of the text that filled the Samsug Galaxy SIII screen, seen in Figure~\ref{glassTestTextLengthRaw}~(a), can be seen in Figure~\ref{glassTestTextLengthS2Text}. As seen the text that filled the Samsung Galaxy SII screen took up roughly two and a half cards in the Google Glass application. Although the screen is nearly filled in Figure~\ref{glassTestTextLengthS2Text}~(c) the text is dynamically sized depending on the amount of text being displayed. As such the card can be deemed about half full. Table~\ref{tab:glassTestTextLengthS2TextTable} shows the exact number of characters and words on each card, showing that the last card contains about half the number och characters as the other two cards.

The result of using the text that filled the Samsung Galaxy SIII screen, seen in Figure~\ref{glassTestTextLengthRaw}~(b), in the Google Glass application can be seen in Figure~\ref{glassTestTextLengthS3Text}. As seen the Samsung Galaxy SIII screen fit more characters than the Samsung Galaxy SII screen and as such three and a half cards in the Google Glass application was needed to display all the text that filled the Samsung Galaxy SIII screen. The exact number of characters and words on each card can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:glassTestTextLengthS3TextTable}.

Instructions described in text may also be displayed in combination with an image. When text combined with an image is used as the design layout for a slide the maximum number of characters that can be displayed changes. The image, according to Google's predefined card layout design~\cite{glassDesignStyle}, makes up \(3/8\) of the card, and as such the text makes up the other \(5/8\). As such the maximum number of characters can be calculated using the maximum number of characters used when presenting only text.

For Samsung Galaxy SII the maximum number of characters when using both text and an image was calculated as follows: \((5/8)*550~=~343.75\). As three quarters of a character is of no use the maximum number of characters on the Samsung Galaxy SII screen is 343 characters. The result of using the same text as when displaying only text on Samsung Galaxy SII, only shorten down to 343 characters can be seen in Figure~\ref{glassTestTextLengthS2Columns}, with specific numbers in Table~\ref{tab:glassTestTextLengthS2ColumnsTable}.

	\end{table}

The maximum number of characters when using both text and and image on Samsung Galaxy SIII was calculated the same way as for Samsung Galaxy SII, as follows: \((5/8~=~468.75)\). As three quarters of a character is of no use the maximum number of characters when displaying both text and an image is as such 468 characters. The result of using the same text as in Figure~\ref{glassTestTextLengthRaw}, only shorten down to 468 characters, in the Google Glass application can be seen in Figure~\ref{glassTestTextLengthS3Columns}. The application requires about three and a half card to be able to display all of the text. The exact number of characters and words on each card can be fount in Table~\ref{tab:glassTestTextLengthS3ColumnsTable}.

Overall a slide in the Google Glass application, which contains only text, can fit around 200 characters, which corresponds to somewhere between 25 to 30 words. When using both text and and image the number of characters that may fit on a slide in the Google Glass application is about 115, which corresponds to about 15 words. In total the Google Glass application requires 3 to 4 cards for every slide in the smartphone application, depending on the size of the smartphone screen, in order to display the same text as a full slide in the smartphone application.

\subsection{Distance to the QR Code}

In Table~\ref{tab:distanceAverage} the average time for registering and decoding a QR code while varying the distance to the QR code can be seen. The size of the QR code was optimised for a distance of two decimeters between the QR code and the device, which also shows in the results as all devices registered the QR code fastest at a distance of two decimeters. The QR code used encoded only one character, an 'a'. The results from every individual run can be seen in Appendix~\ref{app:results}

	\begin{table}[H]%ht!]
    		\caption{Average time of registering a QR code with varying distance.} \label{tab:distanceAverage}
		\centering \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X|X|X|X} \hline
		\textbf{Distance (decimeter(s))} & \textbf{Google Glass (sec)} & \textbf{Samsung Galaxy SII (sec)} & \textbf{Samsung Galaxy SIII (sec)} \\ \hline \hline
       
		1.0	&1.919976807	&1.965959850	&1.839656134	\\ \hline
		2.0	&1.831889852	&1.649790392	&1.487449920	\\ \hline
		3.0	&2.227158610	&1.921767210	&1.568837591	\\ \hline
		
		\end{tabularx}
	\end{table}

\subsection{Complexity of the QR Code}

Table~\ref{tab:complexityAverage} shows the average time for each device to both register and decode a QR code of varying complexity. The distance to the QR codes where two decimeters, as the size of the QR code was optimised for a distance of two decimeters between the QR code and the device. As seen in Table~\ref{tab:complexityAverage} some of the results are infinite, meaning that the device was never able to register the QR code due to the high complexity of the QR code. Samsung Galaxy SIII was able to both register and decode all three of the QR codes, Samsung Galaxy SII was not able to decode the most complex QR code and Google Glass was only able to register the simplest QR code.

One explanation as to why Google Glass was not able to register any QR code other than the simplest one would be that the Google Glass camera did not auto focus as well as both Samsung Galaxy SII and Samsung Galaxy SIII. As such the complexity of the QR code made it difficult to register the QR code. The difference can be seen in Figure~\ref{glassDemoQR}. Every single test run for each device can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:results}.

	\end{table}

\subsection{Display Time}

The average display time of each device, with varying information sizes, can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:averageDisplaySpeedGoogleGlass}. As the size of the information increased, so did the average display time. The increase in time came as a result of all information being downloaded at the same time, and is then handled by the device. Although only the currently visible information is sent to the display, there is still more information handled by the device and as such the device must search through more information in order to determine which information is to be displayed. 

The display time is also affected by other background processes running at the same time. The average display time also only shows the time from when the information was sorted into classes until the information was sent to the display, and as such does not take in to account the potential delay the display might add in order to actually display the information to the user. Every single test run for each device can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:results}.
